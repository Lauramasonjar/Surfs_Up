# Surfs Up

## Project Overview 

To open a *Surf’n’Shake* shop, a shop that sells surf boards and ice cream in Oahu, Hawaii, the weather must be in our favor most days of the year. A perfect spot for the shop is a place with the right balance of warm temperatures, sunny days throughout the year and just enough rain to keep the vegetation green. If those criteria are met, we can be confident that new shop will rise and shine.


## Purpose
To ensure that we will choose the right spot for the shop, we want to make some data-driven decisions; therefore, this analysis focuses on the temperature and precipitation(rainfall) for the past 7 years from 2010 to 2017, specifically for June and December, the two months that are apart enough to ensure that we have a good condition year-round. 


## Requirements

   - Temperature analysis for June and December from 2010 to 2017.
  

## Resources 

**Data Source:**
    - [hawaii.sqlite](hawaii.sqlite)

**Environment:**
    - Python 3.7

**Dependencies:**
   - import pandas as pd
   - import numpy as np
   - import datetime as dt
   - import matplotlib
   - from matplotlib import style
   - style.use('fivethirtyeight')
   - import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
**Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper:**
   - import sqlalchemy
   - from sqlalchemy.ext.automap import automap_base
   - from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
   - from sqlalchemy import create_engine, func

**Software:**
   - Visual Studio Code
   - SQLite("A popular database engine, a version of SQL, that is stored locally and supports quick testing and easy prototyping")
   - SQLAlchemy("A query tool design for SQLite to query SQLite databases")

## Result

The analysis focuses on the temperature and rainfall from six different weather stations on Oahu, Hawaii from 2010 to 2017 for June and December specifically. 

### Comparison of the Temperatures for June and December 

**1. Total Number of data**
  - There is less data for December (1517 data points) than for June (1700 data points).

**2. STATISTICS of the data**
  -	Temperatures are more spread out in December (std = 3.7) than in June (std = 3.3).
  -	June’s mean and median are 74.94 °F and 75.00 °F respectively.
  -	December’s mean and median are 71.04 °F and 71.0 °F respectively.
  -	Maximum temperature in December is 83 °F and in June 85 °F.
  -	Minimum temperature in December is 56 °F and in June 64 °F.

**3. Quartiles**
  -	1st quartile: 25% of all data is below 69 °F in December and 73 °F in June.
  -	3rd quartile 75% of all data is below 74 °F in December and 77 °F in June.

## In addition Precipitation(Rainfall) analysis for June and December from 2010 to 2017.

### Comparison of the Precipitation for June and December

**1. Total Number of data**
  - There is less data for December (1405 data points) than for June (1574 data points).

**2. STATISTICS of the data**
  -	Precipitation quantity is more spread out in December (std = 0.5) than in June (std = 0.33).
  -	June’s mean and median are 0.13 inches and 0.02 inches respectively.
  -	December’s mean and median are 0.21 inches and 0.03 inches respectively.
  -	Maximum Precipitation in December is 6.42 inches and 4.43 inches in June.
  -	Minimum Precipitation in December is 0 inches and 0 inches in June.

**3. Quartiles**
  -	1st quartile: 25% of all data is at 0 inches in December and 0 inches in June.
  -	3rd quartile 75% of all data is below 0.15 inches in December and 0.12 inches in June.

## Summary
Above descriptive statistics provides quick results and tell us weather story about the area.
For more explanations some additional analysis is provided by me. 

### Temperatures for June and December 

From the temperature report we can see that there is not much difference in the weather in June and December, indicating mild and steady temperatures year-round. Mean, median and 2nd quartile data are closely together. It means that distribution of the data is not spread out. For information about protentional outliers and other trends we will plot **the box and whiskers chart**.

From the graph we can see that there are just a few outliers. There are more outliers below the lower boundary in December, however the minimum temperature is 56 °F.

### Calc Funcion 
Function `calc_temps` that will accept start date and end date in the format '%Y-%m-%d' and return the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for that range of dates`'2010-01-01'- '2017-30-12'`
#
### Design a query to retrieve the of Average tobs data and plot the results.  
To see the difference year to year I have provided another graph of **Average temprature grouped by year**.

### Precipitation for June and December

The first difference that we notice is the max prcp in June and December (4.43 and 6.42 inches respectively) and in both cases, which is highly above the mean. 
Standard deviation is also high. And mean, median or 2nd quartile are far apart. Here we understood distribution of the data is highly spread out and indicates the presence of extreme values in the dataset. The easiest way to determine outliers is to plot **box and whiskers chart**.

- There are 183 outliers in June and 205 outliers in December. 
- It is enough power to impact the mean, yet 183 and 205 data points out of 1574 and 1405 respectively is not that much. 
- That indicates isolated extreme rainfall as in precipitation. 
- This analysis captures weather data for 7 years from 2010 to 2017.
